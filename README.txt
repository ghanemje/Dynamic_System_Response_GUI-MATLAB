A MATLAB GUI that simulates a mechanical dynamic mass-spring-damper system.
The user is prompted to enter either a one-mass or a two-mass system. The user should also input the mass, spring constant, damping coefficient, final position, and stop time.
The output is a distance vs. time graph which visually reperesnts the system's dynamic response.
